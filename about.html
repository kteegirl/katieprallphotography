	<!-----------------about me text goes here------------->
	<p class="paragraph indented-text"> My name is Katie (Craven) Prall and I am a photographer located in North Reading, Massachusetts, just 20 minutes north of Boston. I specialize in newborn, infant, maternity and family photography. I am also a single mom of a nine-year-old little girl and a twelve-year-old son. They are my entire world so I know how much your little ones mean to you!</p>
		<br>
	<p class="paragraph indented-text">I take a "less is more" approach to photography where my focus is always on organic emotion, personality and connection.&nbsp; Every family has a story to tell with milestones and moments that are  uniquely thier own. As a photographer it is my job to capture the true essence of these raw and beautiful moments in your lives with a new perspective. I am not a "look at the camera and smile" type of photographer with unnatural posing. For me it's about being in the moment during your session and allowing me to capture the true meaning and definition of what and how you are feeling during this incredibly special time in your lives. </p>
		<br>
	<p class="paragraph indented-text">My family, maternity and lifestyle newborn sessions are more of a joyful documentary style. I want to see the happiness within and document your session with less    of you looking at the camera and more of you interacting with one another. If this is something new to you, don't worry I will help and guide you along the way. I   focus more on moments over poses and less of everyone standing looking at the camera saying cheese!</p>
		<br>
	<p class="paragraph indented-text">My newborn session can take place either in my studio in North Reading for a more formal, posed potrait studio newborn experience (buckets, props, backdrops) or it  can take place in your own home for a more documentary lifestyle newborn session.</p>
		<br>
	<p class="paragraph indented-text">When you book with me, I offer full styling support. Studio sessions are fully styled by me. For maternity, family and lifestyle newborn sessions, you will have full access to my client wardrobe. I have several incredible dresses in natural complimentary colors and styles that create the perfect type of movement which will result in more emotive photos. The other option is that I can style your session and provide you with mood boards and links to purchase the items.  I work with budgets of all sizes.</p>
		<br>
		
	<p class="paragraph indented-text">I would be thrilled to help tell your family's story during these incredible moments of your lives.
